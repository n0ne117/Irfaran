"""Workout trackers: services that hold your activities and will hand them over.

Unlike the live sources, nothing is pushed here. Irfaran asks - on a timer, or
when somebody presses the button - which is the right shape for a service that
already has your history and is the authority on it.

Only intervals.icu so far. It is kept behind a small registry rather than
wired in directly, because a second one is likely and the parts that are not
about intervals.icu specifically - is it on, when did it last run, what did it
say - are the same for any of them.

Two decisions worth knowing about:

  activities arrive as sample streams. There is no GPX endpoint - the first
  version of this assumed there was, on the strength of an unauthenticated
  probe where `/activity/{id}.gpx` answered 401 rather than 404. With a real
  key it answers 404: the 401 came from the security filter, not from a route.
  The original upload is available as FIT, which would mean carrying a FIT
  parser, so streams it is. They are JSON and need nothing.

  Positions arrive as two parallel arrays - `data` holds latitudes and `data2`
  longitudes - alongside a `time` stream of offsets in seconds. The listing
  carries `stream_types`, so an activity with no positions is skipped without
  downloading anything.

  they are ingested as `workout`, the same source a file drop uses. Dedup is
  on (source, external_id) and the external id is the segment's own start
  time, so an activity already imported by hand is recognised and skipped
  rather than drawn twice. Giving this its own source name would have made
  every previously imported workout arrive again as a stranger.
