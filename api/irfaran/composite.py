    The fan-out is over every (view, native tile) pair at once rather than over
    views, and that distinction is most of the speed. Views are wildly uneven -
    the cumulative view covers every tile in the archive while a year view
    might cover five - so a worker per view spends its time watching one job
    finish. One flat queue keeps every core busy until there is nothing left.

    Progress is yielded rather than returned because the only honest thing to
    show during a minute of rendering is how much of it is done, and that has
    to leave this function while it is still working. `written` is filled in
    with the per-view tile counts, since a generator has nowhere good to put a
    return value.

    `skip`, `on_done` and `stop` are what make a render resumable. A queue that
    was interrupted knows which jobs finished, hands them in as `skip`, records
    each new one through `on_done`, and is asked through `stop` whether to keep
    going - so closing a browser or restarting the server costs the job in
    flight and nothing else.

    One caveat for callers writing a script: with more than one worker this
    starts processes through forkserver, which re-imports the caller's main
    module. A script that does its work at import time will do it again in
    every worker. Put it behind `if __name__ == "__main__":`, or pass
    workers=1. The server and the CLI are both already safe - uvicorn owns the
    main module in one, and the other guards it.
