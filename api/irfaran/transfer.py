"""Taking your archive somewhere else.

Only truth travels. The event log is the whole of it - every blob, every tile
and every pixel is derived from those rows and is rebuilt on arrival, so an
export is a few megabytes of JSON rather than a copy of a hundred-megabyte
cache. The basemap does not travel either: it is public map data that the new
instance can fetch for itself, and it is 137 GB.

Three things are deliberately left behind:

  the API token   belongs to the server, not to the archive. Carrying it would
                  silently give the old machine's key to the new one.
  setup state     the new instance has its own first run to do.
  pending renders a note about work owed on tiles that are not being exported.
