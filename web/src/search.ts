// Search, which for now means: paste a coordinate and go there.
//
// The magnifying glass sits beside the settings button and opens a bar across
// the map. Parsing happens on the server - one implementation, tested next to
// everything else, and the same endpoint that will answer with pins and tracks
// when that part is built. Nothing about a search leaves the machine, which is
// the reason an external geocoder was argued against: every query would tell
// somebody else where you were looking.
//
// A found coordinate drops a marker rather than only moving the map. Arriving
// somewhere with nothing to show for it leaves you guessing which pixel was
// meant, and the marker is dashed and hollow so it never looks like a pin that
// has been saved. Saving it is one click, and until then it costs nothing: no
// event, no render, no row.
